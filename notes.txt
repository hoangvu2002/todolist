okay so now I will need a project feature
how can I do that, 
I can add project form control input to the form
add event click event or form submit something like that 
to display all the projects (if it has one) when we reload the page
for all the project name div, attach event handler for displaying task 
with the project name.


Add another checklist feature for taskDiv
